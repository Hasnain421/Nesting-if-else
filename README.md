#  ATM Withdrawal Program

This is a simple Python program that simulates the process of withdrawing money from an ATM.
It checks several conditions such as having a bank account, an activated ATM card, sufficient balance, and entering the correct PIN before allowing the withdrawal.

##  How It Works

1. The program asks if you have a bank account.
2. If yes, it proceeds to check if your ATM card is activated.
3. Then it verifies your account balance.
4. Finally, it checks if the correct PIN code is entered.
5. Only if **all answers are “Y”**, the program prints:

   ```
   You can withdraw money from atm
   ```
